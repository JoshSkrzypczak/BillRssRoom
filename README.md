# BillRssRoom
### WIP using the Room Persistence Library that pulls from the Michigan Legislature's RSS feed of recent bill activity.

Once complete, I'll likely move this over into the production app, [Michigan Legislature](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mi.michigan.josh.michiganlegislature&hl=en), which is currently handling local data persistence through SQLite.

* Retrofit 2 & SimpleXMLConverter
* Room Persistence Library
